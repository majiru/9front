All told, it was three years until I saw him again.  Draped in

I'll admit, the family tended to shunt Tommy aside.  We had shelled
into advanced operations and were channeling most of our attention to
the tactical situation above ground.  Probably some things slipped by
unnoticed.

Maybe I should have sent him back to his mother.  He seemed more
attuned to her.

"Irrelevant.  You're not old enough to have an opinion on this.
Here, hop on up here.  Help me parse these filter rules.  We have

The dream was this:

My wife, my sister and Violet wandering through HQ.  Someone I don't
remember from high school walking up and smearing grease paint on my
face, saying "Don't you remember me?"

My wife, my sister and Violet walking through someone's house as a
shortcut.  The women stop to pick through the occupants' belongings.  I
advise them not to continue but they've become unresponsive.  The
occupants of the hovel wake up and sound the alert for their extended
family, who appear from out of nowhere and accost us.

Hometown Security arrives with shock troops and we are all

By 1963 I had quit smoking, but still I made routine trips to the
balcony to clear my head and to stare at the snow.  There's no telling

I was close.  Ten more months and the agency would have recouped on
my advance.  Then I could start in on the mortgage.  Savings.  Things
