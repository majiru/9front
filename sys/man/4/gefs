.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Gefs
is an experimental file server.
It attempts to be crash safe, snapshotting, and corruption-detecting,
without giving up too much performance.
.PP
Gefs allows multiple snapshots to be mounted and maintained concurrently.
These snapshots all share the same storage pool, but can be written to,
snapshotted, and rolled back independently.
.PP
The snapshot to mount is selected by using the attach specifier when
mounting. If the attach specifier begins with a
.I %
sigil, then the snapshot is mounted in permissive mode.
In permissive mode, permissions are not checked, and
.IR wstat (5)
may change any attributes of any file including the owner.
Unless the file system is started with the permissive flag,
only users in the
.I adm
group may mount snapshots permissively.
.PP
Gefs accepts the following options:
.TP
.B -A
Disable auth. Permissions are still checked, but anyone will be able
to attach as any user.
.TP
.BI "-a " ann
Announce and listen on the specified network address.
.TP
.BI "-f " file
Use
.I file
as the disk.
.TP
.B -g
Grow the file system to fill the current partition.
.TP
.BI "-m " mem
Specify the amount of memory to use as cache.
The
.I mem
parameter recognizes
.IR M ,
.IR G ,
and
.I %
as suffixes.
If left unspecified, it defaults to 25% of installed RAM.
.TP
.BI "-n " name
Use
.I name
as the name of the service.
If unspecified, the default service name is
.IR gefs .
.TP
.BI "-r " user
Ream the file system, erasing all of the old data.
Create a user named
.I user
in the
.I adm
group.
After reaming,
.I gefs
will exit.
.TP
.B -S
Allow permissive mounts for all users.
Additionally, if the user file is unreadable, fall back to the default user table.
Without god, all things are permitted.
.TP
.B -s
Read and write protocol messages on standard file descriptors zero and one.
.TP
.B -t
Set the size of the trace buffer in megabytes.
If set to 0, no debug traces are recorded.
By default, 16 megabytes of trace buffer are kept.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Mount snapshots
.I gefs
from the partition
.I /dev/sdE0/fs
onto a few different mountpoints.
The
.I main
snapshot is mounted to
.IR /n/gefs .
The
.I sys
snapshot is mounted to
.IR /n/gefs/sys .
And finally, the
.I adm
snapshot is mounted in permissive mode to
.IR  /n/adm .
.IP
.EX
gefs -f /dev/sdE0/fs
mount /srv/gefs /n/gefs
mount /srv/gefs /n/gefs/sys sys
mount /srv/gefs /n/adm %adm
.EE
.PP
Initialize a new file system on a device.
Note, this assumes the disk has already been prepared with
.IR prep (8),
and a
.I fs
partition has been created.
.IP
.EX
gefs -r $user -f /dev/sdE0/fs
